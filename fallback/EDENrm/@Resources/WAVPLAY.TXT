WavPlay: Start Guide (WAVPLAY.TXT)

Description
-----------
Formerly known as WavPlayer, it is a Rainmeter skin, or an EDENrm application
that plays PCM audio files. These are usually denoted by the ".wav" file
extension, hence commonly known as "wave files".


Getting Started
===============

    Consider the files you want WavPlay to play.
    --------------------------------------------

Hover over the "[ Directory ]" button, a tool tip should appear showing a
directory path. By default, it is designated to your desktop, so make sure that
your files are there.


    Consider the sequence you want WavPlay to follow.
    -------------------------------------------------

Rename your files into ascending numbers, starting from "1.wav", the first song
in your sequence. For example, a sequence of twenty songs should have files
"1.wav", "2.wav", ..., and "20.wav".

As a side note, you may do the renaming prior to moving the files into the
destination folder.


    Consider the behaviour you want WavPlay to have.
    ------------------------------------------------

Unlike most--if not all--music players, WavPlay plays only one file before
requiring your action, even if you have prepared a sequence of (for example)
twenty files you want it to play continuously. This is the standard behaviour
under Rainmeter's sound playback limitations.

This highlights the usefulness of WavPlay's Automatic Playback Control feature,
which is unfortunately unavailable on the fallback version.


This concludes the end of the start guide. The rest of WavPlay should be able to
help you with their tool tips, they include:

- Playing a custom file
- Setting a custom directory
- Adjusting silence detection parameters (unavailable on the fallback version)

--------------------------
u0r7 fallback by Brendon, 08/23/2018.

Welcome to Rainmeter and EDENrm! ...fallback version.


Introduction
------------
EDENrm, formerly All-in-ONE RMSuite, is a fork of illustro that came with
Rainmeter 2. illustro has been the default suite that comes with Rainmeter.


About the fallback version
--------------------------
This version has been adapted from the original to accomodate users running
Rainmeter 3.3.3 on Windows XP and/or Vista. Unfortunately, not all features
survived this process:

- The Manager and Sound applications have been completely stripped out.

- The main skins, along with Clock, Media, Network, Stickies, System, and
  WavPlay applications have been scaled down. Most importantly, WavPlay's
  Automatic Playback Control feature is missing in this version.

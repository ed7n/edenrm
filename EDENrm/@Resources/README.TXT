Welcome to Rainmeter and EDENrm!


Introduction
------------
EDENrm, formerly All-in-ONE RMSuite, is a fork of illustro that came with
Rainmeter 2. illustro has been the default suite that comes with Rainmeter.


Limitations
-----------
WavPlay's Automatic Playback Control feature will not work properly with some
hardware, particularly with Intel Audio. Check with Sound to see whether your
audio output levels are affected after changing your volume. If so, lower
WavPlay's Sensitivity value to increase its sensitivity to silence. Note that
this value follows an inverse relationship.
